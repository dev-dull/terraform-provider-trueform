## TrueForm
### About
There didn't appear to be any published Terraform providers for TrueNAS Scale for versions 25 and greater (due to the recent change in how the API works), so I decided to burn my Claude Code trial by generating one. It has been mostly written by Claude Code by pointing it at the [TrueNAS 25 documentation](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.04/api/).

The name TrueForm from is taking "form" from Terraform, and "true" from Truenas.
